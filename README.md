# blocksync-fast - synchronize block devices with digest

Blocksync-fast is a program written in C that clones and synchronizes any block devices (entire disks, partitions) or files (disk images) using fast and efficient methods. It uses buffered reads and writes to combine adjacent blocks together reducing the number of I/O operations. At synchronization process program overwrites only changed blocks which reduces data transfer and maintains blocks deduplication in Copy-on-write file systems.

The digest file can be used to store checksums of blocks from a previous sync to avoid read operations from the target disk. This optimization is especially desirable when synchronizing fast NVM drives with slower HDD drives or when transferring data over the network. The program can also creates delta file that stores only differing blocks which can be applied to the destination.

Blocksync-fast uses theÂ Libgcrypt library and supports many hashing algorithms, both cryptographic and non-cryptographic. Optionally, it can also use hashing algorithms from the xxHash family, which offers the very high speed of processed data on processors with SSE2, AVX2 instructions.

## Hashing algos

Hashing algorithms are used to calculate the checksum for each block when using digest files. The smaller block size, the more checksums need to be computed. The length of the algorithm key, which affects the size of the digest file, is also important.

See all available hashing algorithms:

```console
$ blocksync-fast --list-algos
```

The default selection is CRC32 with a block size of 4KB. CRC32 has a hardware acceleration in modern processors with the SSE 4.2 instruction. Your system must support it and the appropriate kernel module should be loaded.

To check whether the "crc32c-intel" module is used in your system:

```console
$ cat /proc/crypto | grep crc32c_intel
```

For installations with the xxxHash library, the default choice is XXH3LOW. The XXH3LOW checksum is the lower 32 bits of the 64-bit hash from the fast XXH3 algorithm.
The instructions (SSE2, AVX2) of the processor will be auto-detected during build program, which will optimize the calculation of XXXH3 checksums.

Choosing the right hashing algorithm depends on user individual requirements and factors such as efficiency in calculations, the block-size or collision resistance. In practice, CRC32 and XXH3LOW for 4KB blocks are a good and sufficient solution.

To see how calculations are performed on your processor, you can run a benchmark and decide which algorithm to select:

```console
$ blocksync-fast --benchmark-algos --block-size=4KB
```

## Block-based backup with rotation, compression and data deduplication

#### Why block-based backup

Block-level backups are used in environments where there is a need to backup entire disks, selected partitions or virtual disk images, preserving the structure of the underlying file system. It allows you to backups independently of the used file system offering more flexibility compared to file synchronization. When synchronizing at the file system level, important metadata can be omitted. While basic POSIX files permissions and attributes can be copied during file-based sync, the preservation of extended file attributes (xattr) can be more challenging. In addition there are more file system features stored in metadata like subvolumes and qgroups in the BTRFS or datasets in the case of ZFS and others whose structure must be specially dumped. The advantage of block-based backup is the ability to quickly restore the full structure of the file system in the event of a failure, along with all data, as well as selectively extract part of the data from the backup due to the ability of mount disk image.

#### BTRFS as backup repository

BTRFS is a Copy-on-Write file system with snapshots and transparent data compression. It is a very well suited for storing deduplicated copies of disk images from many backup cycles, minimizing the occupied disk space.

#### BTRFS compression mount option

BTRFS supports multiple algorithms with various levels of compression. Zstandard (ZSTD) is an algorithm with a good ratio and compression and decompression speeds.

Compression support should be added to the BTRFS file system mounting option in the backup repository:

```console
compress-force=zstd:3
```

#### Local mounted repository

Locally mounted repositories can be disks that are physically located on the server or disks located in a different physical location. The Storage Area Network (SAN) allows direct access to storage over the network. Examples of such solutions are Fiber Channel, iSCSI, FCoE, InfiniBand, AoE. The SAN accesses the device at the block level and mounts it as a native drive whose file system is maintained at the local machine level.

#### Network mounted repository

In the case of using repositories mounted as network resources, a file operations are handled through an additional protocol. Configuration and maintenance of the native file system is done on the remote host that hosts the disk device. Examples of Network Attached Storage (NAS) are NFS or SAMBA/CIFS. Mounting repository via SSHFS (FUSE-based filesystem) can also be applied to this group. Blocksync-fast also synchronizes blocks of files on devices mounted as network resources.

#### Preparing mounted volume to backup

During the process of syncing blocks from an active partition, any changes that will occur in the partition's file system may lead to inconsistency in the disk image backup. To ensure the integrity and consistency of the backup data, it is recommended to freeze the copied file system for the time of sync.
Recommended solution is to use LVM for partition management and take a snapshot of volume. Alternative methods are use fsfreeze on the copied file system or pause, suspend or halt the virtual machine where the partition is mounted.

#### Deduplication on BTRFS repository

File system deduplication allows you to store the same data in different files by referencing common blocks of data in the file's metadata to reduce physical disk usage.
Blocksync-fast during synchronization will overwrite only those blocks that have changed since the last synchronization. In order to share data blocks in the repository from different synchronization cycles, copy the current version of the disk image using the Copy-On-Write mechanism.

Copy with reflink runs on a locally mounted partition or mounted as network repository including NFS 4.2 or SMB 3.

```console
$ blocksync-fast -s /dev/vol -d /mnt/backups/vol-current.img -f /var/cache/backups/vol.digest
$ cp --reflink vol-current.img vol-2023-05-07-00.img
```

Alternatively, deduplication can also be made by creating snapshots in the BTRFS repository. Snapshots can be only taken on the host where the BTRFS partition is mounted locally.

```console
$ blocksync-fast -s /dev/vol1 -d /mnt/backups/current/vol1.img -f /var/cache/backups/vol1.digest
$ blocksync-fast -s /dev/vol2 -d /mnt/backups/current/vol2.img -f /var/cache/backups/vol2.digest
$ btrfs subvolume snapshot /mnt/backups/current/ /mnt/backups/2023-05-07-00/
```

#### Deduplication without Copy-on-Write repository

On repositories with a file systems without copy-on-write you can store delta files containing only changed blocks instead of storing full disk images from different cycles. Delta files should be treated as separate patches that should be applied to the full disk image in the correct order.
The disadvantage of this solution is the lack of direct access to the full disk image for each cycle except the oldest without applying appropriate patches.

Files in repository from 7 days rotation cycles:

```console
vol-2023-05-01-00.img - full image from oldest cycle
vol-2023-05-02-00.delta
vol-2023-05-03-00.delta
vol-2023-05-04-00.delta
vol-2023-05-05-00.delta
vol-2023-05-06-00.delta
vol-2023-05-07-00.delta - patch from the latest cycle
```

Deleting the oldest copy during rotation:

```console
$ blocksync-fast -d vol-2023-05-02-00.img --apply-delta -D vol-2023-05-01-00.delta
$ mv vol-2023-05-01-00.img vol-2023-05-02-00.img
```

Creating the newest copy during rotation:

```console
$ blocksync-fast -s /dev/vol -f /var/cache/backups/vol.digest --make-delta -D vol-2023-05-08-00.delta
```

Restore disk image vol-2023-05-07-01.img:

```console
$ cp vol-2023-05-02-00.img vol-2023-05-06-00.img
$ blocksync-fast -d vol-2023-05-06-00.img --apply-delta -D vol-2023-05-03-00.delta
$ blocksync-fast -d vol-2023-05-06-00.img --apply-delta -D vol-2023-05-04-00.delta
$ blocksync-fast -d vol-2023-05-06-00.img --apply-delta -D vol-2023-05-05-00.delta
$ blocksync-fast -d vol-2023-05-06-00.img --apply-delta -D vol-2023-05-06-00.delta
$ blocksync-fast -d vol-2023-05-06-00.img --apply-delta -D vol-2023-05-07-00.delta
```

## Limitations and Notes

Blocksync-fast is a tool for fast synchronization of block devices, designed to improve block-based backups. To use it as an automatic backup tool, it is recommended to include it in a BASH script, which will allow you to set up a solution adjusted to your individual needs, using various features and tools available in Linux. It should be taken into account the possibility of synchronization interruption due to network disconnection, device detachment, or other errors that may occur. In case of synchronization failure, the program will return an error code greater than 0, which should be handled in the BASH shell and appropriate actions, such as generating reports or retrying the synchronization, should be taken. It is also important to note that when synchronization with the Digest file is interrupted, there may be an inconsistencies between the state of the Digest file and the target storage device. Therefore, after each such interruption, it is recommended to rebuild the Digest file from the target backup or operate on a copy of the Digest file until full synchronization is achieved.

An example backup script with GFS rotation scheme can be found in scripts directory.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>How does this block devices synchronization program work ?</summary>

The program works by comparing the data of the source device (src) with the target device (dst) at the level of data blocks and copying only changed blocks, which allows for fast and file system independent synchronization. Additionally, the program can create and use Digest files that store checksums of blocks to speed up synchronization process by eliminating data reading from the target device.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are the main uses of this program ?</summary>

The program can be used for simple cloning of entire disks or partitions as well as their re-synchronization. The main purpose of the program is block-based backup.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Does the program allow you to synchronize blocks between different devices ?</summary>

You can synchronize data between all devices containing data blocks, both block devices or regular files stored in the file system. Source and destination can be different types.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is a Digest file ?</summary>

The Digest file is generated during block devices synchronization. It stores checksums of blocks copied to the target device, which will be used during the next synchronization to compare the data with the blocks of the source device. This eliminates the need to read blocks from the target device, access to which may be slower. Digest file also store synchronization parameters such as block size or the algorithm used to calculate checksums.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is a Delta file ?</summary>

The Delta file is created as a result of synchronization between the source device and the Digest file, which reflects the state of the target device's blocks. The Delta file contains data only of those blocks that are needed to update the target device. Thanks to this process, it is possible to synchronize and transfer data to a remote server and store incremental copies of data.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How can I monitor the progress of block copying ?</summary>

TheÂ "--progress" should be added as an argument of the program. Also "--progres-detail" can be used to monitor detailed activity.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What data block size is used during synchronization ?</summary>

The default block size is 4KB, which is the preferred block size of most file systems. You can adjust the block size by the "--block-size" parameter without any restrictions, but there is no advantage in setting this size below the underlying filesystem block size.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I synchronize block devices via the network ?</summary>

Yes, however the application itself does not have a built-in client-server option running on its own protocol. You must ensure that the remote disk is mounted via SAN or NAS yourself. You can also use and copy Delta files via pipelining and redirect stdout to stdin on a remote server via SSH.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How to restoreÂ data from a backup ?</summary>

To restore data from a backup, you must reverse the process and specify the source device as the backup file and the target device to which the data is to be restored as parameters. If there are also Delta files in the repository, restore the base copy of the disk image first, then sequentially apply the Delta files in the correct order, starting with the oldest.

If you need to extract only some of the files from the backup, you can directly mount the backup disk image to access the file system: "mount -o loop backup.img /mnt/restore". W przypadku backupu inkrementacyjnego, pliki Delta trzeba zastosowaÄÂ na bazowÄ kopiÄ dysku.

<details>
<summary>What are the differences between this tool and other block syncing tools or backup programs ?</summary>

Blocksync-fast was created for fast and efficient synchronization of block devices. It is written in the C language and it uses low-level operations and directly calls system functions allowing for direct communication with block devices, which translates into effective work and fast data processing. The program minimizes resource consumption through effective memory management, and thanks to the use of a data buffer, it achieves high performance when working on small data blocks.

The program allows you to generate Digest files that significantly speed up the synchronization process by tracking changes and differences between data copies. In addition, Delta files, which contain only differences between data versions, enable quick copying, updating and remote synchronization, as well as data storage in the form of incremental backup.

Blocksync-fast is simple to use and provides you the freedom to build your own script-based backup solution using the Linux tools. It allows you to store data as raw disk image and is not limited to specific repository types like other complex backup programs. You can freely utilize modern file system mechanisms, such as BTRFS, to effectively store data with deduplication and compression.
